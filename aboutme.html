		<p>Originally, starting in high school I had an interest in engineering, specifically electrical engineering. I thought it interesting how electronics worked, and while I the work of electrical engineers is just as complicated and complex as any other engineering field, I felt as though it would be the easiest form of engineering for me personally to grasp. The one problem was that I both hated and was generally bad at math, a quite important part of pretty much all facets of engineering. I could get decent grades in my math classes, but that didn't mean every math class I've had wasn't a total slog or was enjoyable in any way. College algebra was the most taxing, tedious, and stressful class I've ever had (and this extends even into actual college itself), and I wouldn't touch calculus or trig with a 200 foot pole.
So, I was left for a while without an idea of my career path. Until a few AP English classes led me to realize that I could possibly take my career in a direction involving writing. I first I was thinking of fiction writing, but the unpredictable nature of the career of a freelance fiction writer seemed quite daunting to me, so at first, I chose journalism as it seemed the “safest” and most secure career path related to writing. So, I decided to join a broadcasting class, the first of its type, to get a taste of reporting and the multimedia aspect of journalism. I met Donny Ruybal, new instructor of the class and an experienced broadcast journalist and marketing specialist. 
In a way, the broadcasting class was almost a sort of part-time job for me. The extracurricular side of the class  was where I learned the most and gained the most hands-on experience. Shooting live video, running replays, running the live switcher, and even directing a few live productions of multiple sports, including basketball, football, soccer, and wrestling, was my most common type of work with the class. I've also assisted in live productions of assemblies, shows, and district conventions at the Broadmoor hotel.  
 Through these experiences, I gained a new appreciation for the career path, growing as a person both socially, professionally, and in terms of knowledge. Now, as a college sophomore, I have mostly focused on perfecting my writing before branching off into improving my multimedia skills. I feel as though being proficient in both aspects of journalism is what will make me stand out in the competitive field of journalism, and hope that my writing can propel me into the field.</p>
