		<p>My name is Jacob Andersen. I'm a Sophomore Mass Communications major with an emphasis on journalism. Since at least my Sophomore year of high school I've had an interest in journalism and broadcasting, and was in the very first class of the semi-new Broadcasting class at South High School. I have some experience in editing, shooting video, assisting in live productions of pretty much every high school sport you could think of, and have even helped schedule and run Pueblo City Schools PEG channel. I decided to focus my career on journalism instead of broadcasting, since I believe my strong suit is writing, but I also am aware that modern journalism constitutes much more than just writing. While I have gained some experience in the multimedia aspect of broadcasting and journalism as listed above, I hope to gain more throughout college education in order to become a more well-rounded candidate in the competitive field of journalism.</p>
